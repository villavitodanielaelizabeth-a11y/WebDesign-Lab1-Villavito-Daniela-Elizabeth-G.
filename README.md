What is a website, and how is it different from web application?
- A website is a collection of interlinked pages that share information, while a web application allows users to interact and perform specific tasks online.

Why do you think organizations (like offices or schools) need websites?
- Organizations need websites to share information, improve communication, and provide easy access to their services or updates.

What challenges did you encounter while creating your first repositry?
- One challenge I encountered while creating my first repository was learning which is which icon to click.

How might this practice of documentation (README) help in future projects?
- I think it will helps a lot in future projects, because it makes things easier to understand and reminds you what the project is all about.
